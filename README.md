Introduction

##### What is Cookie?

Cookie is a Java and Node-based app that helps you manage Minecraft modpacks. It is made up of two parts, a NodeJS-based web frontend to provide a clean and easy to use UI, and a Java-based backend to serve the necessary files.

##### How would I use it?

- A simple client program, written in [insert language here] to connect to the backend and download the necessary files will be available at release for manual downloads.
- A custom version of MultiMC5 that can parse JSON to create modpack instances will be available soon after release.
